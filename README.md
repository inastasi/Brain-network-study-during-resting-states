# Brain-network-study-during-resting-states
Goal of this project is to analyze two data sets of EEG data and to make a comparison between
them. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that detects electrical activity in brain using electrodes attached to a scalp. Detailed list of performed tasks is given in the Project Report.  
Data  
The EEG data are available from PhysioNet, “EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset” [1]. They
are recorded from 64 electrodes with subject at rest in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions, respectively. For our work we used only data from subject identified as ”S086” collected in the first 2 runs:  
R01 is recorded during eyes-open (EO) and R02 is recorded during eyes-closed (EC) resting states.
